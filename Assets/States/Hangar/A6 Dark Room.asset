  storyText: "A6. Dark Room\nRight, well, that took far longer than anticipated but
    the lock is off and the door opened. Thank goodness for the Pumping Station being
    so loud. \n\nYou're in a dark room. You hear people yelling over the top of the
    combustion boilers. You catch some words. THUNK, THUNK, \"shut off the valves...\",
    THUNK THUNK, \"...get out in time?\", THUNK THUNK, \"...massive pressure\", THUNK
    THUNK \"...for glory\"... THUNK THUNK...\n\nWhat next, Adventurer?\n\n1. Get
    closer to the people speaking.\n2. Ignore them, keep pushing for the airship."
