  storyText: 'A2. In A Cell

    Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal
    beating and end up dumped in a dirty cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The
    door is old and patched together with plate metal and thick red wires.


    You
    have no idea where you are. And your head hurts.


    So, what to do now, slugger?


    1.
    Wait it out. My head hurts.

    2. Slam into the door with all my might.'
